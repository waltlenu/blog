I happened to be on Windows (!), in need to image the contents of a Compact Flash. The reason might be apparent from the screenshot below. [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager) did the job.
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) is a much better way to install [it](https://chocolatey.org/packages/win32diskimager). Both will of course require administrative privileges.
