I’m authoring these pages on a hastily installed ArchLinux workstation. I’m intentionally making this hard on myself in order to document (and implement as code) as many of my personal idiosyncrasies as possible.

I’m making a ton of typing, grammar, syntax and spelling mistakes. I’m hoping this results in some decent dotfiles I can set up on multiple devices.

This installation is so barebones I had to start a GUI with:

```bash
startx /usr/bin/i3
```
