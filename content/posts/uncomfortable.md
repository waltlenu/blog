I'm authoring this pages on an hastily installed Arch Linux workstation. I'm intentionally making this hard on myself in order to document (and implement as code) as many of my personal idiosyncracies as possible.
I'm making a ton of typos, and probably making a lot of grammar, syntax and spelling mistakes as well. I'm hoping this results in at some decent dotfiles I can setup on multiple devices.

This is setup is so barebones I had to start a GUI with:

`startx /usr/bin/i3`

hugo server -D -E -F -w --disableFastRender
