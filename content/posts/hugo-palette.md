I like this [theme](https://github.com/Track3/hermit), but I prefer the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colorscheme. I find it very relaxing and I got used to it.

I messed around with the [custom CSS](/css/custom.css), but I REALLY don't know what I'm doing. I need to fix the code snippets' palette, the rest is good enough for now.

Last time I edited a CSS file it was sitting next to a file that started with:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```
