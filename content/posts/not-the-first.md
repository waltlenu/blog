Here we go again. (Yet) Another attempt at publishing something. Not that it was ever my thing, I never post anything online, I don't use social networks and to be frank, I'm awful at even keeping in touch with people. 

Maybe it's because I just finished listening to the Ready Player One audiobook again (Anorak's Almanac), or maybe because I'm listening to Bal Sagoth, or perhaps I feel the need to organis(z)e some notes about tools and code. Call it New Year Resolution, inspiration or boredom. I'll give another shot but on my own terms, hence the self-hosted nature of this endeavour.

I don't like the layout or it the palette of this theme but it renders, so it's good enough for now. And there's no content worth reading anyway.
