Here we go again. (Yet) Another attempt at publishing something. Not that it was ever my thing, I never post anything online, I don't use social networks and to be frank, I'm awful at even keeping in touch with people.

Maybe it's because I just finished listening to the Ready Player One audiobook again (Anorak's Almanac), or maybe because of the Lockdown, or perhaps I feel the need to organis(z)e some notes about tools and code. Call it New Year Resolution, inspiration or boredom. I'll give another shot but on my own terms, hence the self-hosted nature of this endeavour.

I'm enjoying the speed and layout of this [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder) but I'm not sure about the font and CSS. I'm as far as you can have from a CSS expert but I will eventually try to upload a custom CSS file with a palette more to my liking.

Last time I edited a CSS file it was sitting next to a file that started with:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

I don't like the layout or it the palette of this theme but it renders, so it's good enough for now. And there's no content worth reading anyway.
