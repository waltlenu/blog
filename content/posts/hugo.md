Building this site with [Hugo](Hugo), because it's a static blog generator and it's very fast.

Previewing the site locally, including drafted, expired and future content:
`hugo server -D -E -F -w --disableFastRender`

Previewing the site locally:

I'm enjoying the speed and layout of this [theme](https://github.com/Track3/hermit) but I don't care for the colors. I'm as far as you can have from a CSS expert but I will eventually try to upload a custom CSS file with a palette more to my liking.
